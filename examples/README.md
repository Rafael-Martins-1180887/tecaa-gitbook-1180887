# Examples

As described in the previous sections, the Excess Structural Information Smell has not been extensively explored, so positive examples of how to avoid it may depend on the definition in use, whilst negative examples are usually easier to determine.

Still, a common point in the definition of this smell is that it arises when the documentation focuses too much on the structure of the API itself, such as its endpoints, methods, or classes, instead of providing only meaningful explanations.

As such, this section provides two examples of the presence of this smell in documentation (negative examples) and how to avoid it (positive examples).
