# Documentation Smells

API Documentation Smells are problems that impede developers from using a library or other software tool, leading to frustration, loss of time, and even abandonment of the API.

In a 2021 study, Khan et al. observed that "what" documentation problems were already extensively covered in literature, while in contrast few were the studies focused on "how" problems, that is, on how the documentation is done. Similarly, Treude et al. recently explored how not all API documentation is equally readable, and define a vision for the expansion of this topic.

In a pioneer work in this field, in 2015, Uddin and Robillard surveyed 69 developers and obtained evaluations of 179 examples of good and bad API documentation. They then classified the bad documentation examples according to the problems in them reported, which led to the creation of two categories of defined documentation smell labels and definitions:

* **Content -** How the content is documented.
  * Incompleteness
  * Ambiguity
  * Obsoleteness
  * Inconsistency
  * Incorrectness
*   **Presentation -** How the documentation is presented.

    * Bloat
    * Fragmentation
    * Excess Structural Information
    * Tangled Information



The next major section of this Gitbook explores specifically the Excess Structural Information Smell.
