# API Documentation

A lot of software functionalities are developed as tools (e.g., open libraries and frameworks) that other developers can utilize in their own projects, through the use of their APIs.

{% hint style="info" %}
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are defined as interfaces to reusable software libraries and frameworks
{% endhint %}

Naturally, this means that a developer must properly learn how to use an API, or at least quickly learn the features they intend to use. Otherwise, they will most likely move on to use alternative software to reach their objectives.

To achieve this goal, APIs are usually supported by their own **official documentation**, to the point where API documentation is nowadays viewed as a software product itself, along with the software code.

If good documentation can benefit developers, as expected research shows that bad documentation design can easily lead to a bad user experience with the software tool. These problematic design characteristics are known as **Documentation Smells**.
